      <p>Something about me that have changed ever since I met you.
        I know things are not ideal between us, and sometimes it led me to think that I should just give up.
        I hold on to what I have, and what I can get now, and I am grateful for that.
        I thought that a little bit of waiting won't hurt. I thought that I can be patient enough to wait for you.
        I cried days and nights by the thought of I don't like being treated like this.
        Even so, I had a chance to leave, and to experience so much better with someone else, I chose to wait.
        I felt hurt about everything you did and you might not realized it.
        I felt like I am not enough for you, and I never will. And your actions toward me speak for how I feel.
        Just so you know, whenever I choose to leave, I will always be waiting for you.
        But for the sake of my well-being. I will give up one day about waiting for you.
      </p>
